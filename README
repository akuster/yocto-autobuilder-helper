This repo is designed to work in conjuction yocto-autobuilder. Whilst
yocto-autobuilder is designed to cover all releases, this repo has a branch per
release and contains the hooks that do the actual build configuration and execution.

pre-commit-hook.sh can be used to verify the JSON before committing, symlink this
to .git/hooks/pre-commit (ln -s ../../scripts/pre-commit-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit).
