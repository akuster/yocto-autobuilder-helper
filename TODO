Todo list of things that still need work:

* run-config needs to list the number of failures at the end
* run-config needs to print a header containing 'X of Y' steps
* revision in tgrid is helper script revision, we need poky
* nightly doesn't build
* switch over to and test new publish artefacts script
* convert gplv3 test step?
* convert eclipse build to new helper script?
* add error report uploading functionality
